# SPPU2026
This repository contains the code for the workshop/presentation on "Learning to Model Life: A Hands-On Exploration" at SPPU in January 2026.

We use JSim to simulate dynamical systems modelled using systems of ODEs.

## Download and install JSim:
JSim could be obtained from:
https://www.imagwiki.nibib.nih.gov/physiome/JSim/download

Refer to the instructions on the JSim website for installation and usage details.

If you are using a computer with the **Windows** operating system, download it from:
https://www.imagwiki.nibib.nih.gov/physiome/jsim/download/win64
To download the latest JSim, click on the link `Download the current public release:` and save the file on your computer. It is a compressed file (Zip).
Installation of JSim on Windows is straightforward. 
Unpack the zipped folder that you downloaded in a suitable directory on your computer. 
Inside that unpacked folder, you will find a sub-folder `win64\bin` (`win32\bin`) containing the file `jsim.bat`. Run that `.bat` file by double-clicking. The GUI of JSim will appear. You may create a shortcut of this .bat file on your desktop for easy access.

In case of any difficulty, please follow the instructions on the download page.

## Help video
You can watch the following YouTube video for help with installing and running JSim. Watch from 7 min onwards:

## Model codes:
The repository contains code for two models: Goodwin Model 1 and Goodwin Model 2. 
JSim project file `goodwin.proj` contains both models. Download this `.proj` file and load it on JSim (`file > Open project file`). 
The codes are also provided as text files. One can copy and use these codes and create new projects.
