# SPPU2026
This repository contains the code for the workshop/presentation on "Learning to Model Life: A Hands-On Exploration" at SPPU in January 2026.

We use JSim to simulate dynamical systems modelled using systems of ODEs.

## Download and install JSim:
JSim could be obtained from:
https://www.imagwiki.nibib.nih.gov/physiome/JSim/download

Check the instructions on the JSim website for installation and usage.

If you are using a computer with the **Windows** operating system, download it from:
https://www.imagwiki.nibib.nih.gov/physiome/jsim/download/win64

Installation of JSim on Windows is straightforward. 
Unpack the zipped folder that you downloaded in a suitable directory on your computer. 
Inside that unpacked folder, you will find a sub-folder `win64\bin` (`win32\bin`) containing the file `jsim.bat`. Run that `.bat` file by double-clicking. The GUI of JSim will appear. You may create a shortcut of this .bat file on your desktop for easy access.

In case of any difficulty, please follow the instructions on the download page.

## Help video
You can watch the following YouTube video to get help on the installation and running of JSim. Watch from 7 min onwards:

## Model codes:
The repository holds two models: Goodwin model 1 and Goodwin model 2. 
JSim project files for these models are provided. These can be loaded on JSim and used without any modifications.
The codes are also provided as text files. One can copy and use these codes and create new projects.
